# üí´ About Me:
I am currently undergoing a career transition, transforming my passion for programming from a hobby into a full-time profession. My goal is to become a Full-Stack Developer. To achieve this, I am primarily focusing on the Front-end path, and I am currently enrolled in an advanced course at DNC Technology, as well as the CS50x Harvard course. <br> <br>

I am deeply committed to learning not only the technologies I have already started but also exploring new ones. <br> <br>

In addition to my professional pursuits, I am a person of quiet habits who values spending quality time with my wife and children during my free time.
