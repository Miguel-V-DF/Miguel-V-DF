# About Me:
My name is Miguel Vitta and I am in the midst of a career transition, aiming to turn my passion for programming from a hobby into a full-time profession. My goal is to become a Full-Stack Developer. 

I am on the first period of the Computer Science graduation,and I am really enjoying learning all the base of algorithms and logic, as well as the basics of circuits and the theory on the Engineering of Software and I love learning it in C.

I am also studying outside the university curriculum, currently focusing on the base of Logic and the fundamentals. I did learn how to create basic sites, with HTML, CSS and a little of JavaScript and PHP, and also know the basics on APIs with Node.js. <br> <br>

I am deeply committed to learning not only the technologies I have already started but also exploring new ones. I also enjoy other facets of technology, and use Linux and know the basics of terminal and scripting, as well as making my own home server using a old computer. <br> <br>

In addition to my professional pursuits, I am a person of quiet habits who values spending quality time with my wife and children during my free time. <br> <br>
