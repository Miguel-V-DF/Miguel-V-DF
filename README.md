# About Me:
I am in the midst of a career transition, aiming to turn my passion for programming from a hobby into a full-time profession. My goal is to become a Full-Stack Developer. To achieve this, I am currently focusing on Front-end development, learning JavaScript, and beginning my studies on APIs. <br> <br>

I am deeply committed to learning not only the technologies I have already started but also exploring new ones. <br> <br>

In addition to my professional pursuits, I am a person of quiet habits who values spending quality time with my wife and children during my free time. <br> <br>
